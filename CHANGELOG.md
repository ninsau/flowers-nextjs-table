## [1.3.2] - 2025-09-30

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed double-encoding bug where `sanitizeString` was causing legitimate content to display as HTML entities (e.g., "Internal &amp; Process" instead of "Internal & Process")
- **Critical**: Fixed select-all checkbox not working in controlled mode - callbacks were not being triggered
- Improved controlled state detection in `useRowSelection` and `useTableSort` hooks to properly handle empty objects
- Fixed accessibility issue where select/actions column checkboxes were incorrectly wrapped in button elements
- Removed incorrect `role="img"` from NoContent component for better accessibility

### Changed
- Added deprecation notice to `sanitizeString` function with clear documentation that React handles XSS automatically
- Removed unnecessary sanitization calls from rendering components (React handles this)
- Added explicit return type to `getRowId` default function for better type safety

### Tests
- Enabled and fixed previously skipped "select all rows" test
- All 88 tests now passing âœ…
- Maintained 90%+ test coverage
